# squirrel_Data
I created this project as an assignment for my AP CSA course. It is written fully in Java. 
It analyzes the actions of NYC Squirrels, with data taken from rfordatascience's TinyTuesday 10/29/19. 
(Note: this data has been slightly edited/changed from the original, which is linked here --> https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29

Analyses completed include: 
- percentages of squirrels reacting to humans (run away, run towards, none, etc.)
- what hectacre had the most squirrels
- how many squirrels were recorded as "eating"
- user search based on squirrel color
- user search based on hectacre
